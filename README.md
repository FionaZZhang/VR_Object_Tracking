# Assignment1: First Steps (Group 19)
Virtual Reality applications allow users to immerse in simulated environments. To be able to move in the virtual environment, techniques translating the physical pose to virtual position and orientation is needed. In this assignment, we created a virtual environment and implemented two travel techniques to the player control: joystick walking and teleportation. We have also created a target which can respond to user interactions. This repository consists of our work from Task 2 to Task 4: Task 2 is to design the environment, Task 3 is to implement joystick walking and teleportation, and Task 4 is to implement the target.

# Instructions
Access the scene via Assets-->Scenes-->SampleScene.
## Buttons
### A - jump - avaiable only when stick-movement enabled
### B - change between stick movement and teleportation 
### X - show/hide UI tutorial
### Y - reset checkpoints

### Joystick-walking
Use the left joystick to move in four directions: front, back, left, and right. Use the right joystick to rotate. The speed is set to 5 and the rotation angle is 10. 

### Teleportation
Use left joystick to choose the new position, and right joystick to choose the post-teleport rotation.

## Task 4
Navigate to the target, touch it with your hands. It will respond by changing color, rising up and eventually falling down.
